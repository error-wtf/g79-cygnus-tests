# Section 5.6 - CORRECTED VERSION

## 5.6. Energy Release at the g^(2)→g^(1) Boundary

### **CRITICAL CORRECTION:**
The hot inner shells observed in G79.29+0.46 represent **already-ejected material** that has transitioned from the core (g^(2)) into the surrounding spacetime (g^(1)). They are **NOT within g^(2)** but have already crossed the boundary into the classical expansion regime.

---

### Corrected Physical Picture:

**Domain Assignment:**
```
g^(2) domain (r < 0.5 pc):
  • Cold molecular core (CO, NH₃)
  • T ~ 20-80 K
  • Enhanced temporal density γ_seg < 1
  • Molecular stability from time dilation
  
Boundary (r ≈ 0.5-1.0 pc):
  • Transition zone
  • Energy release during g^(2) → g^(1) decoupling
  • Δv ~ 5 km/s velocity boost
  
g^(1) domain (r > 0.5 pc):
  • Hot ejected shells (ALREADY EXPELLED)
  • T ~ 200-500 K (inner) → 60 K (outer)
  • Ionized gas (H II region)
  • Classical expansion kinematics
```

---

### Temperature Relation Across Domains

**The observed vs. intrinsic temperature:**

The temperature inferred from radiation in the surrounding g^(1)-spacetime differs from the thermodynamic temperature within the temporally dense g^(2) domain:

```
T_obs(r) = γ_seg(r) × T_local(r)
```

where:
- `T_local(r)` = intrinsic thermodynamic temperature within g^(2)
- `T_obs(r)` = temperature measured externally from radiation
- `γ_seg(r)` < 1 inside the dense zone

**Physical interpretation:**
Because γ_seg < 1, local energy accumulates as apparent heat when viewed externally, producing the observed inversion T_obs,inner > T_obs,outer.

This follows from time-dilation scaling of energy density:
```
u_obs = γ_seg(r) × u_local  ⟹  T_obs ∝ u_obs^(1/4)
```
(assuming quasi-thermal emission, Stefan–Boltzmann scaling)

**Temperature spike at boundary:**
When material crosses g^(2) → g^(1), the recoupling temperature jump is:
```
ΔT_recouple ≃ T_local × (1 - γ_seg)
```

The observed temperature peak arises from the released fraction of stored local energy.

### Energy Release Mechanism (CORRECTED):

In the Segmented Spacetime framework, material that **originates within** the temporally dense g^(2) core experiences a fundamental transition when expelled across the boundary into g^(1).

**Within g^(2) (before ejection):**
- Time flows slower: dτ/dt = γ_seg(r) < 1
- Thermal energy suppressed: T_local ~ T₀ γ_seg
- Intrinsic temperature differs from observed: T_obs = γ_seg × T_local
- Material remains cold and molecularly stable
- Energy stored in temporal compression

**At the boundary (during ejection):**
When stellar wind or radiation pressure ejects material from g^(2), it **crosses the segmentation boundary** and re-enters the background spacetime g^(1). At this transition, the previously stored temporal energy is **released kinetically**:

```
v_obs ≅ √(v_launch² + 2c²(1 - 1/γ_seg))
```

**Result:**
- Ejected material gains ~5 km/s additional velocity
- Material heats up as it decouples from temporal dilation
- Inner shells (g^(1)) appear HOT because they are:
  - Already expelled from g^(2)
  - No longer temporally compressed
  - Heated by decoupling energy release

---

### Observable Consequences:

**1. Temperature Structure:**
```
Core (g^(2), r < 0.5 pc):
  → COLD (20-80 K) - still in temporal compression
  
Inner shells (g^(1), r ~ 0.5-2 pc):
  → HOT (200-500 K) - expelled, energy released
  
Outer shells (g^(1), r > 2 pc):
  → COOL (60-100 K) - expansion cooling
```

**This is NOT a thermal inversion!**
- The cold core (g^(2)) remains gravitationally bound
- The hot inner shells (g^(1)) are **already ejected**
- They appear "inside" only geometrically, not dynamically

**2. Velocity Excess:**
The observed Δv ≈ 5 km/s represents:
- Kinetic energy from g^(2) → g^(1) boundary crossing
- NOT from ongoing compression within g^(2)
- BUT from **decoupling** of previously compressed material

**3. Radio-Molecule Overlap:**
- **Cold molecules (CO, NH₃):** Still in g^(2) core
- **Radio continuum:** From hot g^(1) shells
- Spatial overlap because:
  - g^(2) core is compact (r < 0.5 pc)
  - g^(1) shells extend from boundary inward (r ~ 0.5-2 pc)
  - Both appear "inner" in projection

---

### Physical Interpretation:

The key insight is that **g^(2) is NOT the hot inner region** but the **cold core** where molecular gas survives due to temporal dilation. The hot inner shells are:

1. **Already expelled** from the g^(2) core
2. **Heated by decoupling** from temporal compression
3. **Located in g^(1)** but geometrically "inside" the outer expansion
4. **Moving faster** due to boundary energy release

The energy release formula thus describes:
```
Material leaves g^(2) → crosses boundary → enters g^(1)
         ↓                      ↓                  ↓
   Cold, slow          Energy released      Hot, fast
   γ_seg < 1                Δv              γ_seg = 1
```

### Comparison with Observations:

**G79.29+0.46 Layer Structure:**
```
Radius    Domain    T (K)    State           Physical Process
------    ------    -----    -----           ----------------
< 0.5 pc  g^(2)     20-80    Molecular       Temporal compression
0.5-1 pc  Boundary  ~200     Transition      Energy release
1-2 pc    g^(1)     200-500  Hot ejecta      Decoupled, heated
> 2 pc    g^(1)     60-100   Cooling shell   Expansion cooling
```

**This matches:**
- Cold CO/NH₃ in core (Rizzo+ 2014)
- Hot inner shells (Jiménez-Esteban+ 2010)
- Velocity excess (Δv ~ 5 km/s)
- Radio-molecule spatial overlap

---

### Implications:

1. **No thermal paradox:**
   - Cold core (g^(2)) remains bound
   - Hot shells (g^(1)) are already expelled
   - Different domains, different physics

2. **Momentum excess naturally explained:**
   - Ejection from g^(2) releases stored energy
   - Material gains Δv ~ 5 km/s at boundary
   - No hidden forces needed

3. **Molecular stability preserved:**
   - Molecules survive in g^(2) core
   - Hot shells don't destroy them (different domains)
   - Boundary acts as chemical horizon

4. **Universal pattern:**
   - Same mechanism in η Car, AG Car
   - Boundary energy release: E_release ~ c²(1 - γ_seg)
   - Predicts velocity boost for other LBVs

---

### Summary:

**The corrected interpretation:**

❌ **OLD (WRONG):**
"Inner molecular shell remains in g^(2), appears hot"

✅ **NEW (CORRECT):**
"Cold molecular core remains in g^(2).
Hot inner shells are expelled ejecta in g^(1).
Energy release occurs at g^(2) → g^(1) boundary,
producing velocity boost and heating."

**Key points:**
- g^(2): Cold core (< 0.5 pc)
- Boundary: Energy release zone
- g^(1): Hot ejecta + outer shells
- Temperature structure = Domain structure
- Velocity excess = Boundary decoupling energy

---

**This correction aligns perfectly with:**
- Domain separation concept (METRIC_DOMAIN_SEPARATION.md)
- Observed temperature gradient
- Velocity measurements
- Radio-molecule overlap

The hot inner material is NOT defying gravity by being hot inside—it's **already outside** the g^(2) domain!
